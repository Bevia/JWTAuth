THis is one microservice âœ… â€” the JWTAuth service.

It has a few internal components (controllers, filter, service, store), 
but theyâ€™re all inside the same Spring Boot app, running on port 9000.

Your architecture so far looks like this:
â€¢	JWTAuth Microservice
â€¢	AuthController â†’ login & refresh endpoints
â€¢	SecureController â†’ protected endpoints
â€¢	JwtAuthFilter â†’ intercepts requests, validates tokens
â€¢	JwtService â†’ generates & parses JWTs
â€¢	UserStore â†’ (in-memory user/password for now)

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s still one microservice.
